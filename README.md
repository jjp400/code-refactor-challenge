# Horiseon Website - Code Refactoring

The main purpose of this challenge was to refactor the HTML and CSS of Horiseon's web application so that it met certain accessibility standards. Additionally, I was to improve the codebase in other ways, for instance, by:

* making sure all the links were functioning correctly,
* reworking the CSS to make it more efficient, 
* organizing the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and
* adding comments to both the HTML and CSS.

This was all to be done in such a way that the web application's appearance remained the same.

## Built With
