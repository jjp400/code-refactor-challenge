# Code Refactor Challenge - Horiseon

## Purpose
The main purpose of this challenge was to refactor the HTML and CSS of Horiseon's web application so that it met certain accessibility standards. Additionally, we were supposed to improve the codebase in other ways, for instance, by:

* making sure all the links were functioning correctly,
* reworking the CSS to make it more efficient, 
* organizing the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and
* adding comments to both the HTML and CSS.

This was all to be done in such a way that the web application's appearance remained the same.

## Built With
* HTML
* CSS
